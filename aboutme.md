title: About me
---

My name is Ayush Kamat, and I'm currently a 3rd year at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science and Math. I'm involved in the [Cal Band](http://calband.berkeley.edu/), as well as the CS Honor Society [UPE](https://upe.berkeley.edu/). This summer, I am a UGSI for [CS 70](eecs70.org), a course on discrete math and probability theory, where I teach discussion sections and hold office hours. I am deeply interested in the application of optimization algorithms to streamline modern machine learning, and in their applications to control and dynamical systems.
